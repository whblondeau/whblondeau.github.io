        <h1>Bill Blondeau</h1>

        <div class='summary'>
            <p>
            Programmer, Writer, DevOps, Information Designer / Mechanic. Interested in Systems Theory, Semantics, Human Ecology. Former sailor and sculptor. Lifelong reader, especially Fantasy and Science Fiction; recently a published SF writer as well. Love music but not a musician myself.
            </p>
            <p>
            Madison, WI. Year-round bicyclist. Cheerfully and luckily married. Friend of three horses and two cats.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tech Lead at <a href='http://www.musicat.co/the-rabble/'>Rabble</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class='banner'>Currently seeking employment.</h3>
        
        <div class='announcement'>
            <p>
            With regret.
            </p>
            <p>
            I do dearly love my job: the people, the mission, <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm#rabble-musicat' target='_blank'>the exceptional excellence of what we build and provide</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Still, <a href='http://www.musicat.co/the-rabble/' target='_blank'>Rabble</a> remains a small outfit in the underfunded public sector services area. External circumstances oblige me to look for compensation beyond Rabble's reach.
            </p>
            <p>
            At this point, relocating is pretty much off the table. I'm limited either to the parts of Madison, WI within reasonable bicycling distance, or a remote-work position.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>What kind of situation</strong> am I looking for?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Flexible schedule is better than nailed-down.</strong> This operates in three senses. First, if I'm in the zone on a problem, I like to pursue it. Second, my days can get externally logistical, and I want the freedom to take care of business at need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, prolonged butt in chair can lead to mental dullness; when that happens, movement and fresh air are the best fixes. There are times when the most productive thing I can do is climb on my bicycle and go around the lake or something.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>I like, and do well with, remote work.</strong> It dovetails naturally with my need for flexibility, and to incorporate physical exercise into my day. Given GitHub (or similar), SSH access to back-end servers, chat channels, video conferencing, and shared cloud documents, I've got a good track record.
                    </p>
                    Do I therefore reject face to face collaboration? Hell, no. I'm fairly social, and I like sharing space with workmates.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>I deliver more when I'm being pulled rather than pushed.</strong> As a rule, deadlines complicate my workplan and slow me down. On the other hand, when I'm completing tasks methodically, that's when I deliver best <em>and quickest</em>. (Anecdotes available on request. Also, see the item "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast" <a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm#slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast' target='_blank'>here</a>.)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <strong>What type of technical work</strong> am I hoping to be doing? Basically, either something I'm already good with, or something that's unusually compelling.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Data Work.</strong> Whether design, analysis, setup, transformation, validation, maintenance, or a pleasant mixture of them all, data is my first love. It can be tabular, relational, hierarchical, or graph-based; it can be persisted in databases, filesystems; it can be modeled as XML, JSON, CSV or what have you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm very good with XML. (XPath, XSLT, XML Schema, XQuery.) I'm good with JSON and am in fact <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm#jnpath' target='_blank'>working on a personal project</a> to usefully provide XPath-like declarative capability to the JSON world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My command of SQL is very good. I've worked with most of the open and proprietary relational databases. I know how to design schemas and use them. I'm comfortable and experienced with NoSQL databases (Redis particularly). I understand graph theory and various triple notations, and have no difficulty understanding and using graph databases (e.g. Neo4j). I have architected data warehouses, designed star schemas, defined data intake processes, and analyzed the integrity of audit trails.
                    </p>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Programming.</strong> I tend to prefer the back end: data access, service API design and implementation, utility scripting, CLI work. My preferred language is Python; I am also competent with JavaScript (especially NodeJS), and Java. I am familiar with a grab bag of other languages and frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I do have a solid grasp of RESTful and microservice styles of service design and management. I've done both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If I could work with geospatial coding, I'd like to. And I'd very much like to have a chance to work at a Functional programming or Lisp shop. <em>::cough::Clojure::cough::</em>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Technical Writing / Documentation.</strong> I'm good at this. I <a href='techwriter/good_technical_writing.htm' target='_blank'>know how to do it</a>, and why. I treat technical documentation seriously. I have a <a href=techwriter/writing_portfolio.htm target='_blank'>portfolio</a> of work available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I also realize that the worth of this discipline is seldom well recognized, hence doesn't pay well. But I would welcome a chance at a properly compensated position.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>DevOps.</strong> Over a year's recent experience working on Rabble's servers&mdash;under the tutelage of an expert of long standing&mdash;has buffed up my competence with the Linux command line, and my understanding of Linux systems administration, considerably. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This, combined with my ability to write Python scripts (Python is ideal for scripting critical tasks that would be unwieldy for bash), and my long understanding of database operations, version control systems, and API services, qualifies me for a DevOps position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>On Linux only,</em> though. My understanding of Windows system administration is very sketchy.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <strong>Interested?</strong>

            </p>
            <p>
            Availability cannot be immediate&mdash;I have nontrivial responsibilities to Rabble&mdash;but it's negotiable for a good opportunity.

        <h2>What kind of person am I in the workplace?</h2>
        <p class='explanation'><a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm' target='_blank'>This page</a> is sort of a fifty thousand foot view of how I roll, professionally. The software development specific parts (in case you're an eat-dessert-first kind of person) are <a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm#kind_of_programmer_i_am' target='_blank'>here</a>. I think this kind of general information can be more meaningful for a prospective employer than the technical details listed down below; YMMV, of course.</p>


        <h2>Notable skills and aptitudes</h2>
        <p>
        I'm competent or better with a wide range of tools and paradigms, as described in the Resum&#x00E9;s linked below. However, there are a few things that stand out:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>XML (XPath, XQuery, XSLT, XML Schema, SAX, DOM)</li>
            <li>Semantic Web (RDF) and Graph Theory</li>
            <li>SQL / DDL / Relational Databases</li>
            <li>Web service design (especially REST / Hypermedia APIs)</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            <li>Linux CLI</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things I'd like to get better with</h2>
        <p>
        I would certainly give extra consideration to opportunities giving me the chance to work with these.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clojure / Lisps generally</li>
            <li>Geospatial programming</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        Software and project documentation is important. It is seldom done properly: most developers deeply dislike documentation, and aren't too good at it. I do it properly, and feel satisfied about that.

        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p><a href='./developer/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a></p>
        <p>
        I've been doing this for a long time now. I have accumulated a fair set of technical skills; but, probably more importantly, I've learned to understand what matters and what doesn't. I try pretty hard to treat coworkers well, and to work for the benefit of the organization. All this, and technical skills too, in the resum&#x00E9;.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
        I've done this for years, and I know how it works. Besides being courteous, discreet, careful not to talk politics or religion in the workplace, and able to swallow insult or shoulder blame, I'm <em>still</em> ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
        </p>


        <h2>Project History</h2>
        <p>
        My <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm'>software project history</a> is long and detailed. So, separately published.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
        Attended UW-Oshkosh part time from 1982 &mdash; 1988. Multiple major (History, Physics and Art) with minors in Math and German. Accumulated 140 credits with a running GPA of 3.45. Those credits, given the diversity of the majors and minors, did not add up to any degree.
        </p>
        <p>
        I left school for non-academic reasons. I still feel it was extraordinary worthwhile. I learned how to think effectively in multiple intellectual and creative modes. I remain an autodidact; I'm just good at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy describing myself as an Art School Dropout.
