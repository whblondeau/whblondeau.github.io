        <p>
        With regret. I do dearly love my job, but it's a startup in the public sector services area. External circumstances oblige me to look for something better compensated.

        <h2>What kind of person am I in the workplace?</h2>
        <p class='explanation'><a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm' target='_blank'>This page</a> is sort of a fifty thousand foot view of how I roll, professionally. The software development specific parts (in case you're an eat-dessert-first kind of person) are <a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm#kind_of_programmer_i_am' target='_blank'>here</a>. I think this kind of general information can be more meaningful for a prospective employer than the technical details listed down below; YMMV, of course.</p>


        <h2>Notable skills and aptitudes</h2>
        <p>
        I'm competent or better with a wide range of tools and paradigms, as described in the Resum&#x00E9;s linked below. However, there are a few things that stand out:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>XML (XPath, XQuery, XSLT, XML Schema, SAX, DOM)</li>
            <li>Semantic Web (RDF) and Graph Theory</li>
            <li>SQL / DDL / Relational Databases</li>
            <li>Web service design (especially REST / Hypermedia APIs)</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            <li>Linux CLI</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Things I'd like to get better with</h2>
        <p>
        I would certainly give extra consideration to opportunities giving me the chance to work with these.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clojure / Lisps generally</li>
            <li>Geospatial programming</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        Software and project documentation is important. It is seldom done properly: most developers deeply dislike documentation, and aren't too good at it. I do it properly, and feel satisfied about that.

        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p><a href='./developer/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a></p>
        <p>
        I've been doing this for a long time now. I have accumulated a fair set of technical skills; but, probably more importantly, I've learned to understand what matters and what doesn't. I try pretty hard to treat coworkers well, and to work for the benefit of the organization. All this, and technical skills too, in the resum&#x00E9;.

        <h2>Consultant: Software Design &amp; Development</h2>
        <p>
        <a href='./consultant/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a> <em>(organized for the convenience of consulting company recruiters; you may wish to look at the Tech Writer and Software Developer resum&#x00E9;s as well)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        I've done this for years, and I know how it works. Besides being courteous, discreet, careful not to talk politics or religion in the workplace, and able to swallow insult or shoulder blame, I'm <em>still</em> ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
        </p>


        <h2>Project History</h2>
        <p>
        My <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm'>software project history</a> is long and detailed. So, separately published.

        <a name='education'></a>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
        Attended UW-Oshkosh part time from 1982 &mdash; 1988. Multiple major (History, Physics and Art) with minors in Math and German. Accumulated 140 credits with a running GPA of 3.45. Those credits, given the diversity of the majors and minors, did not add up to any degree.
        </p>
        <p>
        I left school for non-academic reasons. I still feel it was extraordinary worthwhile. I learned how to think effectively in multiple intellectual and creative modes. I remain an autodidact; I'm just good at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy describing myself as an Art School Dropout.
