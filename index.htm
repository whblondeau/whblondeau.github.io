            <p>
            Madison, WI. Year-round bicyclist. Cheerfully and luckily married. Friend of three horses and two cats.
            </p>
            <p>
            Senior PHP Developer at <a href='http://www.musicat.co/the-rabble/'>Web Courseworks</a>.
            </p>

        <!--
        <div class='announcement'>
            <h3 class='banner'>Currently seeking employment.</h3>
            <p>
            With regret.
            </p>
            <p>
            I do dearly love my job: the people, the mission, <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm#rabble-musicat' target='_blank'>the exceptional excellence of what we build and provide</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Still, <a href='http://www.musicat.co/the-rabble/' target='_blank'>Rabble</a> remains a small outfit in the underfunded public sector services area. External circumstances oblige me to look for compensation beyond Rabble's reach.
            </p>
            <p>
            At this point, relocating is pretty much off the table. I'm limited either to the parts of Madison, WI within reasonable bicycling distance, or a remote-work position.
            </p>
            <h4 class='notable'>
            Here's an overview of what I'm looking for, what I'm good for, and what I'm like.
            </h4>
            <h4>
            <strong>What kind of situation</strong> am I looking for?
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Flexible schedule is better than nailed-down.</strong> This operates in three senses. First, if I'm in the zone on a problem, I like to pursue it, not knock off because the clock says so. Second, my days can get externally logistical, and I want the freedom to take care of business at need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, prolonged butt in chair can lead to mental dullness; when that happens, movement and fresh air are the best fixes. There are times when the most productive thing I can do is climb on my bicycle and go around the lake or something.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>I like, and do well with, remote work.</strong> It dovetails naturally with my need for flexibility, and to incorporate physical exercise into my day. Given GitHub (or similar), SSH access to back-end servers, chat channels, video conferencing, and shared cloud documents, I've got a good track record.
                    </p>
                    Do I therefore reject face to face collaboration? <strong>Good grief, NO.</strong> I'm fairly social, and I like sharing space with workmates. I've done a lot of good work in 9-to-5 environments.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>
            What type of technical work do I want to do?
            </h4>
            <p>
            Basically, either something I'm already good with, or something that's unusually compelling.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Data Work.</strong> Whether design, analysis, setup, transformation, validation, maintenance, or a pleasant mixture of them all, data is my first love. It can be tabular, relational, hierarchical, or graph-based; it can be persisted in databases or filesystems; it can be modeled as XML, JSON, CSV or what have you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Whatever you want done with XML, I can probably do it quickly. (XPath, XSLT, XML Schema, SAX, XQuery: I haz them.). I'm good with JSON and am in fact <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm#jnpath' target='_blank'>working on a personal project</a> to usefully provide XPath-like declarative capability to the JSON world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My command of SQL and the various DDL dialects is solid. I've worked with most of the open and proprietary relational databases. I know how to design schemas and use them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm good with ETL. I have always had to roll my own data pipelines, transformations, and orchestrations, but am very interested in learning how to use some of the industry tools that take care of the low-level work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm comfortable and experienced with NoSQL databases (Redis particularly).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I understand graph theory and various triple notations, and have no difficulty understanding and using graph databases (e.g. Neo4j).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I have worked as a data architect on warehouses: designed star schemas, defined data intake processes, and analyzed the integrity of audit trails.
                    </p>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Programming.</strong> Strictly speaking, I'm a fullstack programmer. I have worked with asynchronous JavaScript, HTML3, CSS3, XHTTP. Honestly, though, I prefer the back end: data access, service API design and implementation, utility scripting, CLI work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My preferred language is Python; I am also competent with Java. I am reasonably familiar with a grab bag of other languages and frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I do have a solid grasp of RESTful and microservice styles of service design and management. I've done both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I work to leave code in place that's understandable, friendly for sight-reading, unambiguous.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Technical Writing / Documentation.</strong> I'm good at this. I <a href='techwriter/good_technical_writing.htm' target='_blank'>know how to do it</a>, and why. I treat technical documentation seriously. I have a portfolio of example work <a href=techwriter/writing_portfolio.htm target='_blank'>here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I also realize that the payoff of technical writing is seldom well recognized, hence doesn't pay well. But I would welcome a chance at a properly compensated position.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <strong>DevOps.</strong> Over a year's recent experience working on Rabble's servers&mdash;under the tutelage of an expert of long standing&mdash;has buffed up my competence with the Linux command line, and my understanding of Linux systems administration, considerably. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This, combined with my ability to write Python scripts (Python is ideal for scripting critical tasks that would be unwieldy and opaque in bash), and my long understanding of database operations, version control systems, and API services, qualifies me for a DevOps position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>On Linux only,</em> though. My understanding of Windows system administration is very sketchy.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            I'm looking for reasonable compensation. Realistically, some kinds of work are good for that. Others, not so much... but I'm very interested in delivering value that justifies that compensation. Such justification comes down to: what value is an employer willing to put on the work I'd be doing, and how well can I perform that work?
            </p>

        <h2>What kind of coworker am I?</h2>
        <p class='explanation'><a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm' target='_blank'>This page</a> is sort of a fifty thousand foot view of how I roll, professionally. The software development specific parts (in case you're an eat-dessert-first kind of person) are <a href='workplace/workplace_behavior.htm#kind_of_programmer_i_am' target='_blank'>here</a>. I think this kind of general information can often be more meaningful for a prospective employer than the technical details listed down below; YMMV, of course.</p>


        <h2>Notable skills and aptitudes</h2>
        <p>
        I'm competent or better with a wide range of tools and paradigms, as described in the R&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;s linked below. However, there are a few things that stand out:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>SQL / DDL / Relational Databases</li>
            <li>XML (XPath, XQuery, XSLT, XML Schema, SAX, DOM)</li>
            <li>Web service design (especially REST / Hypermedia APIs)</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            <li>Linux CLI</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>Semantic Web (RDF) and Graph Theory</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Data Specialist</h2>
        <p><a href='./datawork/index.htm'>R&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</a></p>
        <p>
        Probably my best skillset. Data in flight, data in repose.
        </p>
        <p>
        Relational/SQL? Whatever you want: from schema design, to implementation DDL, to data ingestion from sources, to complex data queries, to updates. 
        </p>
        <p>
        XML? I can read and write XML Schema, use XPath, XSLT, XQuery.
        </p>
        <p>
        Graph data: RDF, Neo4J. Web Service APIs: design and implementation. NoSQL databases (especially Redis.) JSON. JSON Schema. GraphQL. Tabular forms.
        </p>


        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p><a href='./developer/index.htm'>R&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</a></p>
        <p>
        I've been doing this for a long time now. I have accumulated a fair set of technical skills; but, probably more importantly, I've learned to understand what matters and what doesn't. I try pretty hard to treat coworkers well, and to work for the benefit of the organization. All this, and technical skills too, in the R&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;.
        </p>


        <h2>Technical, Analytical, &amp; Scientific Writing</h2>
        <p><a href='./techwriter/index.htm'>R&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</a></p>
        <p><a href='./techwriter/writing_portfolio.htm'>Portfolio</a></p>
        <p>
        Software and project documentation is important. It is seldom done properly: most developers deeply dislike documentation, and aren't too good at it. I do it properly, and feel satisfied about that.

        </p>



        <h2>Project History</h2>
        <p>
        My <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm'>software project history</a> is long and detailed. So, separately published.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
        Attended UW-Oshkosh part time from 1982 &mdash; 1988. Multiple major (History, Physics and Art) with minors in Math and German. Accumulated 140 credits with a running GPA of 3.45. Those credits, given the diversity of the majors and minors, did not add up to any degree.
        </p>
        <p>
        I left school for non-academic reasons. I still feel it was extraordinary worthwhile. I learned how to think effectively in multiple intellectual and creative modes. I remain an autodidact; I'm just good at learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy describing myself as an Art School Dropout.
