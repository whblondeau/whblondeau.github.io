        <p>
        Willing to consider all kinds of work, but my likely destinations are
        </p>

            <li>Technical Writer</li>

        <h3>Notable skills and aptitudes</h3>
        <p>
        I'm competent or better with a wide range of tools and paradigms. However, there are a few things that stand out: either because I know them inside and out, or because they reach out and grab my brain and won't let go. I would certainly give extra consideration to opportunities giving me the chance to work with these.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>XML (XPath, XQuery, XSLT, XML Schema, SAX)</li>
            <li>Semantic Web (RDF) and Graph Theory</li>
            <li>Clojure / Lisps generally</li>
            <li>SQL / DDL / Relational Databases</li>
            <li>Geospatial programming</li>
            <li>Web services (especially REST / Hypermedia APIs)</li>
            <li>Technical Debt analysis &amp; remediation</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <h2>Consultant: Software Design &amp; Development</h2>
        <p><a href='./consultant/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a> <em>(organized for the convenience of consulting company recruiters; you may wish to look at the Tech Writer and Software Developer resum&#x00E9;s as well)</em>
        <p>
        I've done this for years, and I know how it works. Besides being diplomatic, discreet, careful not to talk politics or religion in the workplace, and able to swallow insult or shoulder blame, I'm <em>still</em> ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
        </p>


        <h2>Technical, Analytical, &amp; Scientific Writing</h2>
        <p><a href='./techwriter/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a>
        <p>
        Software and project documentation is important. It is seldom done properly: most developers deeply dislike documentation, and aren't too good at it. I do it properly, and enjoy doing so.

        </p>


        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p><a href='./developer/index.htm'>Resum&#x00E9;</a>
        <p>I've been doing this for a long time now. I have accumulated a fair set of technical skills; but, probably more importantly, I've learned to understand what matters and what doesn't. I try pretty hard to treat coworkers well, and to work for the benefit of the organization. All this, and technical skills too, in the resum&#x00E9;.</p>


        <h2>Project History</h2>
        <p>
        My <a href='project_hist/software_project_history.htm'>software project history</a> is long and detailed. So, separately published. (The Consultant and Developer resum&#x00E9;s contain their own links to the history.)
