        <h1>First Uptake, Second Uptake</h1>
        <p><em>Bill Blondeau</em></p>

        <div class='provenance'>
            <p>
            This is an augmented excerpt from an article originally published in <span class='pub-ref'>XML Today</span> in early 2010. It's worth publishing on its own, I think: it describes a fundamental pattern that matters a lot in our lives. The writing and the examples hold up pretty well, so the original content has been only moderately edited, with no attempt to update anything that may seem outdated by now.
            </p>

        <h2>Disruptive Technologies</h2>
        <p>
        Some technologies arrive on the scene and are easily integrated into the existing order of things. They provide efficiencies, or open up some additional options; but they don't make any fundamental changes in the ways we do things.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        Every now and then, though, a technology turns out to be seismic. It shifts the ground under us; it shakes things up and topples things that have stood for a long time; and when it's wrought its changes we no longer recognize the places where we used to stand.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sometimes these disruptive technologies are deceptively simple. 
        <p>
        <p>
        The introduction of the mouldboard plough and the horse collar, for example, drastically changed the human ecology of post-Roman Europe, by opening new kinds of soils to cultivation and increasing the characteristic size of the acreage a single farmer could work. A Roman from Gaul, transported to the same region several centuries later, would not recognize the land with its partially deforested valleys, its proliferation of lanes and roads on the cleared land, and its far greater population density.
        </p>
        <p>
        The adoption of game-changing technologies tends to follow a reasonably predictable pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class='hey'>First uptake</span> is the obvious, predictable stuff that doesn't perturb the adopters or their environment all that much.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class='hey'>Second uptake</span> is the subsequent wave of creative, disruptive, emergent innovations: stuff that happens only when we start working out the non-obvious implications. A technology's second uptake often brings considerably better benefit than the first uptake did, but does so at a much greater cost.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The basics</h2>
        <p>
        <em>First uptake</em> and <em>second uptake</em> are arbitrary terms of convenience, describing two kinds of uses to which a new technology is put. Their names are derived from the simple fact that first uptake uses are the first things we tend to try.
        </p>
        <p>
First and second uptakes tend to be like waves that overlap in time. Sometimes the first uptake leads the second by only a little; sometimes the first uptake is pretty well complete before the second uptake begins.
        </p>
        <p>
The differences between first and second uptake are not so much a matter of timing, as a matter of qualities and consequences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ordinary uses, easy wins</h3>
        <p>
        The first things we try to do with any new technology are the straightforward ones: things that we already know we want to do, and things that won't cause anybody a lot of trouble. Think of the first uptake as politely asking, "Mother, may I go pick that low hanging fruit?"
        </p>
        <p>
        When the first uptake has gotten rolling, and baskets of low hanging fruit have been harvested, two changes have occurred. First, we've started noticing that there's still more fruit&mdash;pretty damn tasty, by the looks of it&mdash;on the upper branches; and second, we've had time to start thinking "Hey, if I went up <i>that</i> limb, I could stretch over to <i>that</i> branch over there and haul myself up&#x2026;"
        </p>
        <p>
        Next thing you know, Mom is yelling "You goddamn kids get down out of that tree!" And we're all, "But Mom, look at this great fruit!!11! We can get it easy!" and our hearts are full of second uptake disobedience. (That's not just a whimsical side phrase: second uptake tends to foster challenges to authority; authority is largely founded on patterns of cost/benefit, which is precisely what second uptake alters.) And the baskets of good stuff keep coming down, and Mom stops and looks at that good fruit, and thinks about it, and yells "Well, you'd better be careful!", and then someone <i>does</i> fall out of the tree, and&#x2026; OK, as we know, analogies all end up in the ditch sooner or later.
        </p>
        <p>
        Hopefully, though, this one's sufficiently illustrative of the dynamic of first and second uptake. The easy stuff is the first thing we go for; doing the easy stuff makes us realize that there are other uses we can think about; and only when the more straightforward and less controversial uses are starting to look picked over do a few adventurous souls start climbing into those less accessible places.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let's consider a factual example.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Transistors, first uptake</h3>
        <p>
        The transistor started out as a scientific concept, once physicists had worked out the predicted behavior of electrical charge in a solid semiconductor. It took quite a long time before the first working transistor was actually built, and that one was only a lab experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
        But everyone working with transistors saw the obvious, familiar, practical use: do what a vacuum tube does, i.e., analog signal processing. (Note, though, that the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=uBFMAAAAEBAJ">first transistor patent</a>, filed in 1926 by physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld, says <em>"The invention has for a further object a simple, substantial, and inexpensive relay or amplifier not involving the use of excessive voltages"</em>&mdash;a pretty clear description of the physical requirements of digital electronics, requiring only to be combined with the contributions of Boole, Babbage, and Lovelace to ignite our current digital explosion. 1926. Physicists are <i>bad</i>, I tell you.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Transistors are actually not as good as vacuum tubes in terms of signal quality. To this day, audiophiles and musicians use tube amps when they want very high signal fidelity above a low noise floor.
        </p>
        <p>
        But, from the beginning, transistors were cheaper and much more rugged. Also, because they were a lot smaller physically, consumed less power, and accordingly shed a lot less heat, it was suddenly possible to start packing electronics into smaller enclosures&mdash;sometimes even battery-powered enclosures. The first uptake of transistor technology was to make consumer goods such as radios, televisions, and phonograph amplifiers, and military hardware such as airborne radio and radars, that were, like the transistors themselves, smaller, cheaper, and more rugged.
        </p>
        <p>
        That's a pretty pure example of how first uptake goes. Smaller, more affordable appliances aren't really a game-changer in any real respect. The benefit to consumers was real but incremental, and didn't do anything disruptive beyond gradually driving vacuum tube manufacturers out of business; but businesses that can't find a place in changing conditions go under all the time. That's pretty much accepted as the behavior of an economy subject to technological progress. Perhaps you could argue that battery-powered transistor radios were somewhat disruptive, but they didn't <i>really</i> make a mess out of anything.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the second uptake of transistors had already gotten rolling, because the people who ran the big early digital computers were getting mortally tired of having one electron tube among their banks of thousands blow out in the middle of a computation.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Transistors, second uptake</h3>
        <p>
&#x2026;OK, do I really have to recapitulate this?
        </p>
        <p>
        Suffice it to say that at the moment I'm writing this on a ZaReason linux box with an Intel Core 2 Duo at 3Ghz, 8GB of RAM, an NVidia GeForce 9600 graphics card, a 1TB hard drive, and a 1680x1050 flatscreen display. And I'm not even bragging, because it's a very nice machine but not particularly a hotrod (and I'm not a hardware guy anyway&mdash;embarrassingly I had to resort to <code>lshw</code> to verify some of that, and in turn had to use <a href='http://www.theonion.com/articles/google-launches-the-google-for-older-adults,5850/'>The Google</a> (which fortunately I'm old enough to qualify for) because I had forgotten the <code>lshw</code> command.)
        </p>
        <p>
        I am, further, composing this article as a Google Doc, so I can edit from various locations. I will edit the final draft as raw HTML before publishing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Meanwhile, my wife is on her iMac, running her level 75 paladin through some Blue Sky Logging Camp dailies. (And yes, now I am bragging&mdash;dontcha wish your girlfriend was Horde like her?) When her paladin is on the bat in transit to someplace far away and she doesn't feel like watching the astonishing landscapes roll by below, she switches over to a Facebook group she's created, that has as of this writing pulled in over a thousand fans from all over the world, and jumps into the discussion threads there for a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
        And it's not like we're all that unusual, nor affluent&mdash;this is just how you roll, these days.
        </p>

        <h3>Transistor uptakes compared</h3>
        <p>
        Think about what a technically or scientifically educated person from 1947 (the year the first transistor was demonstrated at Bell Labs) would have made of these two contrasting descriptions of transistor uptake. The first uptake description would have been entirely comprehensible; the second uptake would have been unintelligible (well, perhaps not <em>completely</em> unintelligible, especially the World of Warcraft bits, if our hypothetical educated person were also a fantasy/science fiction reader with a good projective imagination.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Almost every significant term in the remarks about the transistor's second uptake has been coined, or has acquired new meaning, because of the transistor. And it's not just terminology&mdash;I've deliberately included references to, and implications of, just a few manifestations of the immense technological, social, economic, and creative changes that have swept over our civilization since we've gone digital.
        </p>
        <p>
All because of engineers elaborating on "a simple, substantial, and inexpensive relay or amplifier not involving the use of excessive voltages".
        </p>
        <p>
I don't know how to more vividly illustrate the difference, in terms of character, of meaning, and of potential for disruption, between first and second uptakes.
        </p>

        <h2>Second uptake is expensive</h2>
        <p>
        Disruption of any kind always imposes costs. The extravagant disruptions attendant on second uptake bring their share.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Contextual costs</h3>
        <p>
        Any technology exists in a real-world environment. The impacts of second uptake are felt as systemic disturbances. Ecological, physical, ????????????????????
        </p>

        <h3>Adaptive Stress</h3>
        <p>
        Turning from those distinctions of significance and disruptiveness to a more pragmatic arena, we come to the question of personal burden.
        </p>
        <p>
        First uptake is not nearly as rough on the psyche; second uptake demands a lot more of us. Even when we're feeling exhilarated by the new vistas that second uptake opens up, our brains are still doing some extra lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
        Normally, "adaptive stress" is a term used by biologists when discussing the behavior of organisms, but I think its proper home is in systems theory. It seems to apply pretty universally to economics, management, social consensus, politics, ecology, etc., all of which (like biology) are disciplines that concern themselves with complex systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Cognitive costs</h3>
        <p>
        As individuals, as disciplines, and as organizations, we reduce the mental workload of day-to-day life by the process of figuring things out. We keep investing in that process until we've got a sufficiently refined conceptual model, one that lets us think more efficiently (i.e., without reinventing core conceptual structures from scratch every time we need to use them for a thought process).
        </p>
        <p>
        When, however, we are confronted with some kind of situation that tells us that some conceptual model we've come to rely on is no longer adequate, we need to rethink. That process of rethinking, and integrating the rethought model with other related conceptual models we have figured out, causes us to experience adaptive stress.
