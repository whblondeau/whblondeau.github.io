            NGWMN is composed of multiple components that interact in ways that are obvious, and ways that are not obvious.
            </p>
            <p>This page contains explanations, specifications, procedures, tips, tricks, folklore, and arcane voodoo rituals that can help a developer exercise the pieces correctly.

            <a name='three_basic_params'></a>
            <h1>The 3 basic parameters</h1>
            <p>
            For any kind of work with NGWMN, you will typically need to know three bits of info:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong><a href='data_and_service_definitions.html#service_alias'><span class='service-alias'>service-alias</span></a>,</strong> which defines which service you're calling.</li>
                <li>The <strong><a href='data_and_service_definitions.html#agency_alias'><span class='agency-alias'>agency-alias</span></a>,</strong> which identifies the source from which the Mediator gets its data.</li></ul><ul>
                <li>The <strong><a href='data_and_service_definitions.html#site_id'><span class='site-id'>site_id</span></a>,</strong> which is the agency's identifier for the well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <em>Note that these parameters are actually named different things in different parts of the app and for different data. &nbsp;For instance, for the SOS data service from the Mediator, <span class='site_id'>site_id</span>&nbsp;is called <strong>featureId</strong>, for QW data it is called <strong>siteid</strong>.</em> These variations are <a href='data_and_service_definitions.html#ngwmn_data_defs'>described</a> on the NGWMN Data and Service Definitions page.
            </p>
 
            
            <a name='dashboard'></a>
            <h1>The NGWMN Data Cache Dashboard</h1>
            <p>
            <strong>This is the place to go to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find out <strong>what wells are available for the NGWMN on your server.</strong></li>
                <li>View metadata about <strong>the Cache and the prefetch operations</strong> that populate it.</li>
                <li><strong>Manually execute a <a href='data_and_service_definitions.html#prefetch'>prefetch service call</a></strong> to refresh Cache Data for a particular well, for a particular service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            To get there, go to <strong>&lt;your server's hostname and port&gt;/<span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Context redacted&nbsp;</span>.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            For example, for the dev server: http:<span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Hostname redacted&nbsp;</span>/<span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Context redacted&nbsp;</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
            This gets you to a display page that lets you access wells, and metatdata about cache prefetch operations.
            </p>
            <p>
            The most useful links are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class='fakelink'>Well List</span> <em><span class='digression'>(complete flat list of wells on the NGWMN server)</span></em></span></li>

                    <ul class='fakelink'>
                        <li>Prefetch list for IL EPA</li>
                        <li>Prefetch list for MPCA</li>
                        <li>Prefetch list for ISWS</li>
                        <li>Prefetch list for NJGS</li>

                        <li>Prefetch list for TWDB</li>
                        <li>Prefetch list for MBMG</li>
                        <li>Prefetch list for USGS</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The cache can only access wells that are listed in the Well Registry, which is a separately managed component. The Well Registry varies by tier: the Dev and QA registries (and thus those caches) do not contain all the wells. I think this is by design so that the non-production servers do not use so much storage and/or are easier to test. If you are trying to diagnose a problem w/ a particular well in production, it may not be possible to access it on Dev or QA.
            </p>

            <h1>Mediator</h1>
            <p>
            The Mediator is an Apache Cocoon application, which means that <strong>it's a set of processing <em>pipelines</em> that are mapped to characteristics of an HTTP Request.</strong> The output of the selected pipeline is used to generate the corresponding HTTP Response. See the <a href='cocoon_and_mediator.html'>Cocoon and Mediator Technical Overview</a> for more detailed information.
            </p>
            <p>
            The one most important thing you need to know about the Mediator: <span class='notable'><span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Context redacted&nbsp;</span>/sitemap.xmap</span>.
 Application logic is defined in Cocoon by <span class='notable'>sitemap.xmap</span>, which declaratively describes the Request matches and the structures of pipelines. <span class='notable'>sitemap.xmap</span> files are distributed recursively in Cocoon. Fortunately, the Mediator's logic is defined in a single <span class='notable'>sitemap.xmap</span> file. See 
            </p>

            </p>

            This is unfortunately a bit harder. Go to <span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Context redacted&nbsp;</span>/sitemap.xmap and look up the web service call listed there. &nbsp;You will have to piece together the appropriate url using the logic in the xmap file. Unless you are paranoid or have reason to suspect something weird is happening, you should be able to use the <span class='notable'>'cocoon-view=source'</span> flag described above.</span>

            <h2>How do I do a <strong>Regression Test</strong> on the Mediator?</h2>
            <p>
            A scripted Regression Test has been written for the Mediator. It is included in the Mediator source code <span class='redacted'>&nbsp;Internal Project redacted&nbsp;</span> in its own separate subfolder.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            The regression test is a <strong>brute force approach,</strong> which favors accumulating a lot of information as the default behavior, and allowing the tester to decide how, and how heavily, to inspect the new data. This approach is potentially very expensive in terms of time and server load. Therefore:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The regression test is not intended for automated use.</strong> It should be executed by a human (preferably one who understands what s/he is doing.)</li>
                <li><strong>The regression test should be used on the dev server</strong>, or perhaps QA; <em>never prod</em>
 unless there's a sufficient reason for doing so. It's intended to catch regressions due to code changes, not server deployment errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The regression test works as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>There is a&nbsp;<strong>baseline or reference (aka "ref") dataset</strong> that contains all of the data for <strong>all</strong> of the wells, for <strong>all</strong> of the agencies, for <strong>each</strong> service that can be called. This is established once, and replaced only seldom. (The dev server uses a reduced dataset; it took ~ 1.5 hours to 
get everything.) This is in a "ref" folder on the machine from which you are running the tests.</li>
                <li>When you want to perform a regression test, you specify how much of the full
 dataset you want to test. The parameters (set in a configuration file) are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Which agencies</li>
                        <li>Which services</li>
                        <li>the maximum number of wells per agency.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Executing the regression test creates a test data folder (which can basically be named anything <em>except</em> "ref") containing the data.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The regression test offers a superficial canary-in-the-mine utility,&nbsp;quick-scan-new-results.py, that can quickly identify certain kinds of discrepancies. However, it also stores the messagebody of every successful(<strong>"successful" meaning HTTP status code &lt; 400</strong>) invocation. You can do what you like with those XML files: compare them with manual applications such as oXygen; script automated inventory using python, or command line with xmllint; do simple file compares; look at them in a text editor and gnaw your thumbnail; etc. It's up to you.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <a name='regression_test_howto'></a>
            <h3>A quick regression test HOWTO</h3>
            <p>
            <strong><u>First:</u> Get the latest regression test code and data from source control.</strong> Note that, if <strong>ref.zip</strong> has changed, that will take a little extra time to download.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong><u>Next:</u> you will need to install Python and the 'requests' and 'lxml' Python modules.</strong>

            <p>This is <strong>the archive containing the official baseline data</strong> for comparison to your new run. <span class='warning'>Do not edit this file. <em>Ever</em>.</span> ...But if you do, decide whether to commit your changes (e.g., if it's intended to be only a local copy, be very careful to <strong>not</strong> commit your changes.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Please remember that <strong>the ref data is server-specific.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>If regenerating this data,</strong> here's your quick checklist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you also plan to update <span class='notable'>wells.txt</span>, do that <em>first.</em></li>
                <li>Make sure that <strong><span class='notable'>wells.txt</span> specifies the same server</strong> for which you will be doing the ref regeneration.</li>
                <li>Think very carefully about the configuration entries you want in test-config.txt. <span class='warning'>You will be hating your life if you do a big long run without setting up the configuration correctly.</span></li>
                <li>Remember, for a regeneration&mdash;an <strong>update of the baseline</strong>&mdash;you should commit your changes unless something awful happens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Your regeneration operation should go like this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Edit <span class='notable'>test-config.txt</span> to ensure all agencies and services are uncommented, and that you do <strong>not</strong> have any uncommented number entry under MAX WELLS PER AGENCY. These things will ensure that <span class='notable'>get-well-data.py</span> will not exclude any wells.</li>
                <li>Verify that you have the correct server selected in <span class='notable'>test-config.txt</span>.</li>
                <li>Run <span class='notable'>get-well-data.py</span>. Pick a non-confusing folder name, like <strong>newref</strong>.</li>
                <li>Go do something else. Have lunch, work on a different project, change the transmission in your car, something.</li>
                <li>If it completes successfully, change the name of your target folder to <strong>ref/</strong>. <span class='warning'>And I <em>know</em> you verified that the content of <span class='notable'>ref</span> was backed up</span>. Say you started with <strong>newref</strong> as suggested above:
<!-- preformatted, so we outdent -->
<div class='code console'><span class='grn'>&#x279C;</span> ~ <span class='grn'>$</span> rm ref
<span class='grn'>&#x279C;</span> ~ <span class='grn'>$</span> mv newref ref
<span class='grn'>&#x279C;</span> ~ <span class='grn'>$</span>

</div>
                <li>If you want to create a new <span class='notable'>ref.zip</span>, do this, or the moral equivalent of this:

service call you attempted: win, lose, or draw) and possibly several more (for each <strong>successful</strong> response, an XML file holding the messagebody.)
