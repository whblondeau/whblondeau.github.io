        These links point to written pieces of various kinds. Their purpose is to allow prospective employers, clients, or collaborators to judge my ability as a writer. This portfolio is obviously weighted towards Technical Writing; but the nontechnical nonfiction essays, and even the fiction, might have something useful to say.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a rule, these pieces are not very long or complicated. My sense is that shorter pieces probably deliver more bang for the buck. One exception: the <a href='#ngwmn_documentation_excerpts'>NGWMN Documentation Excerpts</a> are drawn from a large, complicated, and highly technical documentation project, and consequently run long. (Anyone who wants to assess my hardcore technical documentation chops should probably start with that one.)

        <h2>Technical Writing</h2>
        <p>
        Most of my Technical Writing proper has been done on closed, internal systems for clients. Here are some publicly available examples:
        </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                Samples drawn from an extensive documentation effort. The NGWMN Groundwater Portal was and is a large, complicated application built and operated by <a href='http://cida.usgs.gov' target='_blank'>USGS/CIDA</a>. The folks at CIDA report that this particular product continues to prove useful, which gives me a fair amount of professional satisfaction.

                The <a href='https://www.nagios.org/' target='_blank'>Nagios</a> open source application for monitoring systems, networks, and infrastructure. Nagios works via plugins. This README provides usage and a conceptual overview for a simple Python plugin I wrote to monitor the health of Apache Tomcat servers on the network.

                This project is intended as a demonstrator for the fundamental problems of geospatial programming. It's essentially the use of language design to create salient representations of key cartographic abstractions.

                How to tie basic knots. And, what they are good for.

                <p>
                Don't assume that <em>Technical Writing</em> means "high tech". There are <a href='good_technical_writing.htm' target='_blank'>principles of good technical writing</a> that make documentation understandable, and help the reader to grasp the material. These principles apply to low tech just as seriously as to the latest structures of symbolic logic and microelectronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                This wiki is currently unfinished. It's intended to back up a series of classes on basic knotwork at <a href='thebodgery.org' target='_blank'>The Bodgery</a>, a local makerspace: after the students have seen the knots explained and demonstrated during class, they will be encouraged to practice the knots every day. This material will help them to not forget how, and when, to use the knots.
                </p>
                <p>
                <em><strong>Intended audience:</strong> Students of basic knotwork at a makerspace.</em>

                A meditative look at the hopeful nature of the Tech Industry, as seen through (somewhat bedazzled) beginner's eyes at Madison Ruby 2012. I was a brand new Bendyworker at that point, and saw a lot of things that left me exhilarated. I also saw the possible encroachment of Enterprise norms as a threat to the community.

                RailsBridge helps women get into programming via brief, intensive workshops that introduce prospective developers to Ruby on Rails. It begins with an Install Night, in which participants bring their laptops, and mentors help ensure that the latest Ruby and Rails are properly installed. The same kind of thoughtful approach characterizes the entire workshop.

                <p>
