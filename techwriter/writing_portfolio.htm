        These links point to written pieces of various kinds. Their purpose is to allow prospective employers, clients, or collaborators to judge my ability as a writer. This portfolio is obviously weighted towards Technical Writing; but the nontechnical nonfiction essays, and even the fiction, might have something useful to say.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a rule, these pieces are not very long or complicated. My sense is that shorter pieces probably deliver more bang for the buck.

        <h2>Technical Writing</h2>
        <p>
        Most of my Technical Writing proper has been done on closed, internal systems for clients. Here's are some publicly available examples:

                </p>
                <p>
                The <a href='https://www.nagios.org/' target='_blank'>Nagios</a> open source application for monitoring systems, networks, and infrastructure. Nagios works via plugins. This README provides usage and a conceptual overview for a simple Python plugin I wrote to monitor the health of Apache Tomcat servers on the network.

                This project is intended as a demonstrator for the fundamental problems of geospatial programming. It's essentially the use of language design to create salient representations of key cartographic abstractions.

                </p>
                <p>
                How to tie basic knots. And, what they are good for.
                </p>
                <p>
                Don't assume that <em>Technical Writing</em> means "high tech". There are <a href='good_technical_writing.htm' target='_blank'>principles of good technical writing</a> that make documentation understandable, and help the reader to grasp the material. These principles apply to low tech just as seriously as to the latest structures of symbolic logic and microelectronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                This wiki is currently unfinished. It's intended to back up a series of classes on basic knotwork at <a href='thebodgery.org' target='_blank'>The Bodgery</a>, a local makerspace: after the students have seen the knots explained and demonstrated during class, they will be encouraged to practice the knots every day. This material will help them to not forget how, and when, to use the knots.
                </p>
                <p>
                <em><strong>Intended audience:</strong> Students of basic knotwork at a makerspace.</em>

                An article originally published in Kurt Cagle's <em>XML Today</em>. A 101-level introduction to the theory and nature of Complex Systems: how they dominate the real world we inhabit, but resist our linear thinking and vector-based sciences.

        <h2>Fiction</h2>
        <p>
        I've written some fiction. A couple of pieces have been accepted for publication. Here are drafts of some as yet unpublished works that seem to hold some promise&#x2026;

                </p>
                A fantasy short story. By intention, one of several loosely related tales about art students in an imaginary land in which magic does work&mdash;but doesn't guarantee happiness or success any more than art does.
