        <h3>USGS/CIDA: pywqp Water Quality Dataset Client &mdash; June to September 2014</h3>
        <p class='role'>Developer</p>
        <p>
        The <a href='http://waterqualitydata.us' target='_blank'>Water Quality Data Portal</a>, built and operated by CIDA, offers a web client for download of large datasets. This project created a complementary scriptable Python client to accomplish the same task. See <a href='https://github.com/wblondeau-usgs/pywqp' target='_blank'>the pywqp GitHub repository</a> for code, documentation, and details.

        <h3>USGS/CIDA: NGWMN Groundwater Service extension &mdash; July 2013</h3>
        <p class='role'>Developer</p>
        <p>
        CIDA had collaborated with the Canadian agency <a href='http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/science/water/groundwater/10988' alt='NRCAN Groundwater site' target='_blank'>NRCAN</a> to do some proof of concept cross-border groundwater data sharing, connecting the <a href='http://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/' target='_blank'>National Groundwater Monitoring Network</a> (NGWMN) via parts of the <a href='http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos'>OGC Sensor Observation</a> web services.
        </p>
        <p>
        On a short timeframe, NRCAN requested that the SOS service suite be fully implemented to support a cross-border information sharing demo for the United Nations. I assisted with that, and received a knowledge transfer from a departing engineer while doing so. I <strong>documented</strong> everything I could learn about the NGWMN.
        </p>
        <p>
        Apparently the UN was duly impressed with the demo.
        </p>

        <h3>USGS/CIDA: Automated Installer for WDNR Fish Mobile AppDecember 2013 to January 2014</h3>
        <p class='role'>Developer, Researcher</p>
        <p>
        There was no automated install/update utility for the new Fish Mobile App, and WDNR needed to install it on a lot of Windows tablets. Working with a tech-savvy Project Lead, designed and built a utility that installed Python and CouchDB (adjusting for variations in the Windows security model), and then used Python to control installation and setup of the application via CouchDB's REST API. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Very interesting (and oddly rewarding) project.
        </p>
        <p class='tools'>Python, CouchDB, REST, Python Requests, Windows cmd.exe</p>
        
        
        <h3>USGS/CIDA: Technical Debt containment advocacy &mdash; April 2013 to March 2015</h3>
        <p class='role'>Analyst, Evangelist</p>
        <p>
        Ongoing campaign to introduce the concept of <a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html' target='_blank'>Technical Debt</a>; to raise awareness of Technical Debt's nature and severity; and to advocate for its containment and reduction, among management and staff at CIDA. This was particularly important given CIDA's funding model and large deployed portfolio of successful major applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        Gratifyingly, CIDA to this day uses Technical Debt as a concept when reasoning about architecture, design, and support for applications.
